<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The first steps on using Webstorm are to download the requisite software,set the applications before you use them, and finally get them to work.</p>

<p>Once you have finished,you will need to create a GitHub account.</p>

<h2>Adding a Password to Webstorm</h2>
<p>Press Ctrl+Alt+S again,and clickAppearance and Behavior,System Settings and then Passwords. Add a location for the password file and then click OK.</p>
<h2>Creating a Repository</h2>

<p>Now, open back up Webstorm. Click Version Control on the bottom left and click Create Git Repository. Name the file, and then click OK.</p>
<h2>Importing a Repository from Github</h2>
<p>To import a repository from Github, select Navigate from the top left, type in Get from Version Control, and copy-paste the repository URL that you created from the section 'Creating a Repository'.</p>
<h2>Creating a Webstorm File</h2>
<p>To create a Webstorm File, right click the folder,denoted by the fact that it has a folder symbol next to it as well as the URL. Then, click New and create the file of your choice.

<h1>Glossary</h1>
<ul>
<li>Branch</li>
<p><strong>Branching</strong> is a powerful mechanism that allows you to diverge from the main development line, for example, when you need to work on a feature, or freeze a certain state of a code base for a release, and so on.</p>
<li>Clone</li>
<p><strong>Cloning </strong>a repository is when you clone an existing repository and create a new project based on the data you have downloaded.</p>
<li>Commit</li>
<p>A <strong>commit</strong> is a file stored in .git/objects that specifies a snapshot. It contains one or more references to the parent <strong>commits</strong> and a reference to a tree object.</p>
<li>Fetch</li>
<p><strong>Fetching</strong> makes it so that all new data from commits that were made since you last synced with the remote repository is downloaded into your local copy. </p>
<li>GIT</li>
<p><strong>GIT </strong> is a version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
<li>GitHub</li>
<p><strong>GitHub </strong>is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git.</p>
<li>Merge</li>
<p><strong>Merging</strong> is <strong>merging</strong> two sequential and compatible XML tags into one larger tag. </p>
<li>Merge Conflict</li>
<p>A <strong>merge conflict </strong>is when an issue arises with code, most usually occurring when an operation fails. You will then be asked to resolve this conflict.</p>
<li>Push</li>
<p><strong>Pushing</strong> files involves <strong>committing</strong> files locally to record the snapshot of your repository to the project history, and then <strong>pushing </strong>them to the remote repository so that they become available to others.</p>
<li>Pull</li>
<p><strong>Pulling </strong>involves getting changes  into the current branch from another branch instead of its remote tracked branch. When <strong>pulling </strong>is involved,new data is downloaded along with integrating it into the local working copy of the project.</p>
